Run it from command prompt and it would ask for no of epochs.Training for atleast 10 epochs is reccomended.
but for convolutional one even one epoch would be enough to see results.

After training it would save the binary file with hash codes and show the 10 closest digitsto '0' based on hamming distance.

Look at the comments in code to visualize results for different digits or run the notebook.

The third one just shows reconstruction results for cifar-10. Searching needs to be done manually on the notebook.
